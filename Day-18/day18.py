# Day 18: In the GitHub repository, Infinity-AI(Infinite Learn and Grow)/30-days-code inside the Day-18 folder create your_name.py file as defined in the readme.md file.
# 1. Write a pattern which identifies if a string is a valid python variable
# is_valid_variable('first_name') # True
# is_valid_variable('first-name') # False
# is_valid_variable('1first_name') # False
# is_valid_variable('firstname') # True

# 2. Clean the following text. After cleaning, count three most frequent words in the string.
# sentence = '''%I $am@% a %tea@cher%, &and& I lo%#ve %tea@ching%;. There $is nothing; &as& mo@re rewarding as educa@ting &and& @emp%o@wering peo@ple. ;I found tea@ching m%o@re interesting tha@n any other %jo@bs. %Do@es thi%s mo@tivate yo@u to be a tea@cher!?'''

# print(clean_text(sentence));
# I am a teacher and I love teaching There is nothing as more rewarding as educating and empowering people I found teaching more interesting than any other jobs Does this motivate you to be a teacher
# print(most_frequent_words(cleaned_text)) # [(3, 'I'), (2, 'teaching'), (2, 'teacher')]
